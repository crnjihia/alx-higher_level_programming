## Introduction

As part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum, this repository will help you build proficiency in higher-level programming languages. You will learn the core principles of languages such as Python, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms, as well as how to apply these concepts to solve real-world problems.

Each folder in this repository contains project files related to specific tasks from the ALX curriculum, covering various concepts from scripting to algorithmic programming and software development.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

├── 0x00-python-hello_world/ 
├── 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions/ 
├── 0x02-python-import_modules/ 
├── 0x03-python-data_structures/ 
├── 0x04-python-more_data_structures/ 
├── 0x05-python-exceptions/ 
├── 0x06-python-classes/ 
├── 0x07-python-test_driven_development/ 
├── 0x08-python-more_classes/ 
├── 0x09-python-everything_is_object/ 
├── 0x0A-python-inheritance/ 
└── README.md


Each folder represents a different project or concept and contains the following:

- Python scripts (`.py` files)
- C files (where applicable)
- Task-specific resources (where applicable)
- Test files and scripts for testing the programs (if provided)

## Language Usage

This repository uses Python, a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. Python is widely used in web development, automation, data science, and software engineering.

Some projects may also include C code, especially when learning about systems programming and memory management.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x** or later
- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** (as required by ALX projects)
- **pycodestyle** for Python coding style checks
- **Betty linter** for C code style checks
- **gcc compiler** for compiling C programs

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/crnjihia/alx-higher_level_programming.git
